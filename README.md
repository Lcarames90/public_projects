# **Public Projects**
Analytical project portfolio to demonstrate technical proficiencies.
1. Python Generally - Focus on Pandas. Numpy *if* applicable
2. SQL + BigQuery - Will flash BigQuery syntax and structure & do some manipulation IN Pythonic using BigQuerySQL queries.
3. MatPlotLib + SeaBorne - Get some data visualizations going for the housing data
4. Regression Modeling - Maybe.

For this project, I'll be exploring housing prices within a 3 decade span from roughly 1990 - 2024, starting with Denmark, for no specific reason other than it was available & interesting. 

I'll be operating outside of Kaggle as well, using open data API's & whereever else I can find housing data to aggregate and create models to glean insight.

**Data Sets:**
1. **Danish Housing Data 1992-2024 - Credit to Martin Frederiksen & Kaggle** for the data<br>
Source to his working GitHub:<br>https://github.com/MartinSamFred/Danish-residential-housingPrices-1992-2024.git<br>
Kaggle site where I sourced the Data via KaggleHub:<br>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinfrederiksen/danish-residential-housing-prices-1992-2024

2. **US Census Data**<br>This set is to be used for SQL proficiency
<br> Might be worth it to demonstrate general SQL proficiency by creating a MySQL DB locally and leveraging MySQL Workbench to pull query's. Can also demonstrate an ETL pipeline of sorts.
