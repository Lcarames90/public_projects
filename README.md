Analytical project portfolio to demonstrate technical proficiencies

For this project, I'll be exploring housing prices within a 3 decade span from roughly 1990 - 2024, starting with Denmark. 

Why did I choose Denmark? Well it was the first dataset that piqued my interest.

I'll be operating outside of Kaggle as well, using open data API's & whereever else I can find housing data to aggregate and create models to glean insight.
